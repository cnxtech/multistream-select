> length-prefixed-message for length-delimited packetizing multistream

# Description

length-prefixed-message is a trivial protocol that "packetizes" an arbitrary stream. It is used to wrap arbitrary streams of data as varint-length delimited messages. This ensures the other side can stop.

# Motivation

length-prefixed-message give the other side the ability to know how large an incomming message is. This makes it easy to allocate appropriately sized buffers, and makes the _end_ of the message known.
